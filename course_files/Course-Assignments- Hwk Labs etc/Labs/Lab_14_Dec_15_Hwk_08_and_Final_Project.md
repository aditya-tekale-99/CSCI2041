### CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Fall 2020

**There is nothing to turn in for this lab.**

Today's lab will be spent discussing questions you may yet have
regarding Hwk 08 and Final Project.

Eric, Eduardo, and Perry will hold general discussions in the open
Zoom meeting for the lab. Join the queue on Slack to meet with the other TAs
to discuss specific issues with syntax or type errors that may be preventing
your progress.
