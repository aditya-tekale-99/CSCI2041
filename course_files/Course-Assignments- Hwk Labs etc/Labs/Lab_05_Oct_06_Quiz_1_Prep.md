# Lab 5: Quiz 1 preparation

### CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Fall 2020

**There is nothing to turn in for this lab.**


## Quiz 1 Preparation

The primary work to do today is to prepare some files for Quiz 1.

### File setup

In your individual repository, create a ``Quiz_1`` directory.  This
will be next to your other directories such as ``Lab_01`` and
``Hwk_01``.


Next, create a file name  ``quiz_1.ml`` in that ``Quiz_1`` directory.

In that file

1. add an OCaml comment at the top containing your name.

2. read the paragraph below, after you have read it, add the paragraph
in a second comment in the file.

   ```
   I understand that the work to be done on Quiz 1 is to be done on my
   own, without any help from my classmates or others.  Discussing the
   questions or solutions is an act of academic misconduct and I
   understand the penalties as laid out in the syllabus for this.
   ```

3. next, add the following definition of ``even`` in your file

   ```
   let even x = x mod 2 = 0
   ```

Now add, commit, and push this file to your individual repository.

Check on github.umn.edu that your changes were successfully pushed by
viewing the ``quiz_1.ml`` file there.


## Hwk 02

If time allows, you may use this time to discuss Hwk 02 with your TAs.
